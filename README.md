## Tiled PDF

TiledPDF is a nice little extention for [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) <br>
For several versions now, Inkscape has offered the option of managing document pages. The extension automates the creation of new pages in a grid, with these pages overlapping in a specific way (controlled by parameters). When exporting to a PDF file, objects that extend beyond the page margins are precisely divided between the corresponding pages. This is particularly useful when large drawings need to be distributed across several smaller sheets of paper — for example, when printing a pattern for sewing projects.
